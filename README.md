## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with a knack for problem-solving through data. I started as a web developer but transitioned to data science after discovering how powerful data can be in finding solutions. 

### ðŸŒŸ My Baby Project: Bet Tips Validation Model
I recently built a project that validates betting tipsâ€”a fun way to deepen my understanding of data pipelines, web scraping, and machine learning models. Automating this data pipeline was an essential part of the learning journey, teaching me the importance of blending software engineering with data science to handle end-to-end processes efficiently.

### ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™m Learning
Currently focusing on expanding my software engineering skills to automate and enhance my data workflows, making each project smoother and faster. This way, I get to spend more time on meaningful data analysis!

Letâ€™s connect and talk data, automation, and everything in between!
